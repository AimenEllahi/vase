      Please note the following update concerning the registration for student
      visa appointments: As already announced since October 13th 2023 on this
      website the Embassy will open the student visa registration list on
      November 15th 2023 for students holding an admission letter from a German
      university for Bachelor or Master studies for summer semester 2024.
      Unfortunately, the Embassy was not able to fulfil all appointment requests
      for winter semester 2023 due to the enormous interest of potential
      students. This demand far exceeded the capacities of the Embassy. We
      understand the disappointment this may have caused to those applicants who
      could not be considered. All remaining registrations of students holding
      an admission letter from a German university for Bachelor or Master
      studies for winter semester 2023 will be cancelled before November 15th,
      the candidates will receive an automatically generated information by
      e-mail about the cancellation. As of December 4th appointments for
      Bachelor and Master students holding an unconditional direct admission
      letter for summer semester 2024 will be entertained.
